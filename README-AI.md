## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **`app/`**: Contains the Next.js pages using the App Router.
- **`components/`**: Reusable React components.
- **`context/`**: React Context for global state management.
- **`templates/`**: Page templates that assemble components.
- **`public/`**: Static assets like images and icons.
- **`styles/`**: Global and component-specific styles.
- **`mocks/`**: Mock data for development and testing.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helpers.
- **`constants/`**: Application-wide constants.
- **`types/`**: TypeScript type definitions.
- **`tests/`**: Test suites for components and pages.
- **`README.md`**: General project documentation.
- **`README-AI.md`**: Detailed codebase explanations and documentation.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**: Records of all significant changes.
- **`package.json`**: Project dependencies and scripts.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration.
- **`next.config.js`**: Next.js configuration.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Tailwind CSS configuration.

## Components

### Layout Components

#### `components/Layout/index.tsx`

**Purpose**: Serves as the root layout for all pages, providing a consistent structure across the application.

**Features**:

- Includes the **Header** and **Footer** components.
- Wraps children components with global providers (e.g., `AppProvider` for context).

**Example Usage**:

```jsx
import Layout from '@/components/Layout';

const Page = () => (
  <Layout>
    {/* Page content */}
  </Layout>
);

export default Page;
```

## Backup and Version Control

### Documentation Backup System

To ensure the safety and integrity of our documentation and codebase, we implement the following backup strategies:

#### 1. Automated Daily Backups

- **Documentation Backup**: All documentation files (README.md, README-AI.md, and inline documentation) are automatically backed up daily.
- **Location**: Backups are stored in both local and cloud storage:
  - Local: `/backups/docs/YYYY-MM-DD/`
  - Cloud: Secure cloud storage with versioning enabled

#### 2. Version Control Integration

- All documentation changes are tracked through Git
- Each significant documentation update creates a new tag
- Documentation versions align with code releases

#### 3. Backup Rotation Policy

- Daily backups retained for 7 days
- Weekly backups retained for 1 month
- Monthly backups retained for 1 year
- Annual backups retained indefinitely

### Backup Verification Process

The Master Librarian is responsible for:

1. Verifying backup integrity daily
2. Performing monthly backup restoration tests
3. Maintaining backup logs
4. Reporting any backup failures or issues

### Emergency Recovery Procedure

In case of documentation loss or corruption:

1. Access the most recent backup
2. Verify backup integrity
3. Restore to the last known good state
4. Document the recovery process
5. Review and update backup procedures if necessary
